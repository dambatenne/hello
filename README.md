# Important

This is a dummy library that propagates the OS version for Android and iOS.
It is not for any kind of usage, but only for my experiments with Flutter packages.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter
[plug-in package](https://flutter.dev/developing-packages/),
a specialized package that includes platform-specific implementation code for
Android and/or iOS.

For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
[online documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.
